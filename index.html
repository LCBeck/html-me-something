            <h1>My Hawaii Vacation</h1>
            <article>
                 
                <p>My family went on a really great vacation to Hawaii when I was 14 years old.</p>
                    <img src= "images/Hawaii.jpg" style= "width:500px;height:400px">

                <p>We stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki.  In the picture below you can see how it is really</p>
                        <p>close to the beach.  It was a beautiful hotel with a nice view of Diamond Head.</p>

                <p>We went to a Luau while we were there. You can see in the picture below some of the hula dancers.</p> 
                    <p>That honestly was amazing and I'm glad we went to it.</p>

                    <p><q>The Hula is the heartbeat of the Hawaiian People.</q></p>
                   
                <p>Hanauma Bay is the next picture. We went there specifically to snorkel.  There are colorful fish everywhere in the water.</p>
                <p>It's in a bay so there aren't sharks so it feels pretty safe.</p>

                <p>In the picture below you can see we went to Volcanos National Park to see lava rock that has cooled and formed over roads, trees and plants.</p>
                    <p>These are my cousins, Lyla and Adrian, in the picture that came with us on our vacation.</p>

                <p>I feel like we were very lucky to visit Hawaii.  These are definitely some places you</p>
                <p>should visit if you are able to go. The weather is beautiful and so many memories can be made. </p>
