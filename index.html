                <p>My family went on a really great vacation to Hawaii.</p>
                    <img src= "images/Hawaii.jpg" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
                <p>We stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki.  It was a beautiful hotel at the beach with a nice view of Diamond Head.</p>
                
                <p>We went to a Luau while we were there. That honestly was amazing and I'm glad we did it.</p>
                    <q>The Hula is the heartbeat of the Hawaiian People.</q>
                <p>We snorkeled in Hananama Bay. There are colorful fish every everywhere in the water.</p>

                <p>We went to Volcanos National Park to see lava rock that has cooled and formed over roads, trees and plants.</p>

                <p>Those are definitely some things you should try if you go to Hawaii.  </p>
